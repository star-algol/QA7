<h4>
    <p>The solar system was formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago by the collapse of a giant molecular cloud. The
        mass at its centre collected to form the Sun and a flat disk of dust around it. This eventually formed the
        planets and other bodies of the solar system.</p>
    <p>*The solar system consists of the Sun, planets, dwarf planets, moons, and numerous smaller objects such as comets
        and asteroids.</p>
    <p>*194 moons, 3,583 comets and 796,289 asteroids have been found in the solar system.</p>
    <p>*99.86% of the solar system’s =mass is found in the Sun. The majority of the remaining 0.14% is contained within
        the eight planets.</p>
    <p>*The combined mass of all the moons in the solar system is less than 0.1% of the Earth’s mass.</p>
    <p>*The four smaller inner planets, also known as the “terrestrial planets”, are primarily composed of rock and
        metal.</p>
    <p>*The four outer planets, also known as the “gas giants”, are substantially larger and more massive than the inner
        planets.</p>
    <p>*The two innermost gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, are the largest of the four outer planets and are composed
        mainly
        of hydrogen and helium.</p>
    <p>*The two outermost gas giants, Uranus and Neptune, are composed largely of ices (water, ammonia and methane).
        Together they are referred to as the “ice giants“.</p>
    <p>*Other structures of note in the solar system the Asteroid Belt, Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud.</p>
